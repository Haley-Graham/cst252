			<h1>Lab 16: Libraries & Intro to jQuery</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented with jQuery and then had it display the results.
				We transfered this information into a Javascript file, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into many problems with this assignment. Because we practiced in class and just
				added one simple element to what we already know, this assignment was fairly easy. For some reason, I was unable to change the color of the
				button to green with just using JavaScript. I even tried removing the portion of my CSS file with button styling, and still had no luck so
				I left it matching my theme.
