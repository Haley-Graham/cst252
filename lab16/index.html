			<h1>Lab 16: Libraries & Intro to jQuery</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented with JavaScript classes and then had it display the results.
				We transfered this information into a Javascript file, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS.
			 	We also wrote an OOP design for the game Hangman.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into many problems with this assignment. Because we practiced in class and just
				added one simple element to what we already know, this assignment was fairly easy. For some reason, I was unable to change the color of the
				button to green with just using JavaScript. I even tried removing the portion of my CSS file with button styling, and still had no luck so
				I left it matching my theme.

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the HTML I wrote for lab 16, styled with CSS. In addition to the output of the JavaScript.</p>
