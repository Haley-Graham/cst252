			<h1>Lab 14: Javascript Classes and Objects</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented with JavaScript constructors and then had it display the results.
				We transfered this information into a Javascript file, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS. </p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into any problems with this assignment. Because we practiced in class and just
				added one simple element to what we already know, this assignment was fairly easy.

			<h2>Results</h2>
