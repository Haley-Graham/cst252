			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented with JSON and AJAX APIs, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into many problems with this assignment, but was fairly challenging. Even though we practiced in class,
				I still had some troubles. At first I was getting the CORS error, but I fixed it by turning on the extension I forgot we downloaded in class.
				I did try to add the next and previous buttons to my page to switch between different XKCD comics, but could not get it to do all of the things,
				so I turned the JS code that did not work into comments and left the buttons not working. I even tried going to Wes's page to straight copy code
				and it did not work.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the JavaScript output with the XKCD comic pulled from the API, as well as the HTML I wrote for lab 20, styled with CSS.</p>
