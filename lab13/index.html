			<h1>Lab 13: Debugging</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we used our debugging knowledge to fix old assignments, and included screenshots of how we did it.
				We fixed the Javascript files of the labs, and created and styled this HTML with CSS. </p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into many problems with this assignment. Looking back at labs we could not get to work with fresh
				eyes helped us figure out new ways to find the solutions to our problems in order to debug the labs. </p>

			<p>What you are seeing is the HTML I wrote for lab 13, styled with CSS. In addition to the debugging of Lab 10 and the screenshots.</p>

			<h2>Debugging</h2>
			<p>Because I already knew there was something wrong with the function I was using for Lab 10, the first thing I did was just
			play with it and see if I could figure it out just going back and forth from Atom and Inspect in the browser. I could not figure it out,
			so I reread the directions and were it said to use Wes's function from the lab stood out to me. I desided to just copy and paste it into
			my JavaScript, attribute it to him, and see if it works. It fixed my problem, I realized I was missing a few words and the seperate function
			that shuffled the array (which was why I was getting my name back unshuffled). Also, because the function was not being read, there was no
			output in the div just in the console. This was also fixed when the function was fixed. </p>
