			<h1>Lab 12: Loops</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented using loops within our JavaScript and then have it display the results.
				We transfered this information into a Javascript file, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS. </p>
		</div>

	<div id="challenges">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into many problems with this assignment. Experimenting with loops and starting the
				assignment in class in smaller groups together helped a lot. I found the images in the lab directions are different
				and more complicated than what the directions were telling us to do. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the HTML I wrote for lab 12, styled with CSS. In addition to the output of the JavaScript.</p>
