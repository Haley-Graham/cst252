<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
<p>In this lab, we started pseudocoding. We wrote the steps for a morning routine and how to upload code to the server. </p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The only challege my partner and I ran into was the directions. When we got to putting our
	pseudocode into a javascript file, we were confused. Neither of us have experience with javascript
	to we just tried to follow the directions as best we could.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
