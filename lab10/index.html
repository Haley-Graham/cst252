			<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented using JavaScript to add an event listener to a button and then have it display the results.
				We also transfered this information into a Javascript file, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS. </p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I ran into quite a few problems with this assignment. Personally, the first problem I ran into was that the function would not work.
			I would not get a shuffled vervion back, just the regular spelling. I tried using the short version of the function and the long one and still
		couldn't figure it out. I had no problem having it same the input to the console, but when it came to adding it to the div for it to be shown I was again
		unable to figure it out. I went through all of my resources including w3schools, the lecture presentaion, my notes, my partner, js fiddle, and freecodecamp.
	I have spent so much time trying to figure it out, I think it is best if I moved on without a working website, or at least the JavaScript. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the HTML I wrote for lab 10, styled with CSS. In addition to the output of the JavaScript.</p>
