			<h1>Lab 11: Conditionals</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented using JavaScript to create a function that depends on conditionals and then have it display the results.
				We also transfered this information into a Javascript file, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS. </p>

	<div id="challenges">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into as many problems with this assignment as we did with Lab 10. Experimanting with conditionals in
        small groups together in class helped a lot.  </p>

	<div id="results">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the HTML I wrote for lab 11, styled with CSS. In addition to the output of the JavaScript.</p>
