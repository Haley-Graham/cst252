	<p>I'm Haley! I am a Communication Design Major with a concentration in visual
		design and this is my second year at CSUMB. I love art, plants, coffee, music,
		and traveling. I also have a kitty named Appa, he is a long-hair Siamese cat
		and he's the best. I am excited to further develop my coding skills in this
		class, and hopefully make some new friends. </p>
