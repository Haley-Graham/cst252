			<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented with anonymous functions and callbacks.
				We also transfered this information into a Javascript file, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS. </p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into any challenges while completing this lab. This is just completely new material to us,
				so it took us some time to get it working. Working in class helps a lot as well.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the HTML I wrote for lab 8, styled with CSS. In adition to the output of the JavaScript.</p>
