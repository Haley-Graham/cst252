	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<p>In this lab, we wrote the code for the home page and included links to the labs.
			We also completes lab 3 in which we explained the challenges and results of our work</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The only aspect I found challenging about this lab was that I wanted to add
			CSS to my home page and I had forgotten how to move around images where I want them,
			but with the help of w3schools I found the solution quickly.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>What you are seeing is the HTML I wrote for lab 3 with a screenshot of my homepage styled with CSS.</p>
