			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented declaring variables, arrays, and objects in the Javasript Consol in
				our browsers. We also transfered this iformation into a Javascript file and created and styled this HTML. </p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into any challenges while completing this lab. We only ran into a few syntax errors.
				For example, using an equal sign instead of a colon. I got a lot of help in class working in breakout rooms.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the HTML I wrote for lab 6, styled with CSS.</p>
