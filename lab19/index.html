			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented with jQuery and AJAX APIs, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into many problems with this assignment.Because we practiced in class and just
				added one simple element to what we already know, this assignment was fairly easy. At first I tried to use the Kanye API,
        but I could not get it to work because it was already a string when I went to its url, and I kept getting [object Object] in my output.
        I also kept getting the Mixed Content Error, even though the API I was using was secure. </p>
		</div>

	<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the button for the JavaScript output as well as the HTML I wrote for lab 19, styled with CSS.</p>
