			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented with jQuery and AJAX APIs, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS.</p>
		</div>

	<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>This assignment was fairly challenging. Even though we practiced in class, I still had some troubles. At first I kept getting the Mixed Content Error, because the API I was using at first was not secure even though it worked locally.
        Then I tried to use the Kanye API, but I could not get it to work and I kept getting [object Object] in my output. I thought it might have been
        because it was already a string when I went to its url. </p>
		</div>

	<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>What you are seeing is the button for the JavaScript output as well as the HTML I wrote for lab 19, styled with CSS.</p>
