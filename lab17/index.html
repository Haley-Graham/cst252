			<h1>Lab 17: Advanced jQuery</h1>
			<p>In this lab, we experimented with jQuery some more and the toggle class function.
				We transfered this information into a Javascript file, along with creating and stylling this HTML with CSS.</p>

			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>My partner and I did not run into many problems with this assignment. Because we practiced in class and just
				added one simple element to what we already know, this assignment was fairly easy. At first I was having the same problem as I did in the last
				lab, the color or the button would not change. I realized that in my HTML the CSS was linked above the JS, so I switched them and it worked I figured 
				that the CSS must have been being read before the JS.
